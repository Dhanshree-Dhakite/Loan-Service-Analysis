# Loan-Service-Analysis
In this project, we’ll use Financial Information available for a loan service provider. We’ll try to examine the Customer base, loan portfolio & performance and financial risk analysis on the dataset.
We’ll visualize the different charts on different pages and format the visuals to make a clean dashboard.

Insights :-
1. High Financial Risk from Medium and High-Income Buckets
Out of the total 519 defaulted loans, 407 (78%) are from medium and high-income buckets.
Similarly, High-Risk Loans are heavily concentrated in High (949 loans) and Medium (952 loans) income segments, collectively contributing to ~75% of high-risk loans.
This counters the usual assumption that only low-income segments are risk-prone.
2. Employment Status Impacts Default and Risk
Among defaulted loans, the largest share comes from the Self-employed and Full-time groups.
Self-employed: $7.32M (27.95%)
Full-time: $6.79M (25.94%)
Similarly, high-risk loans show Self-employed and Full-time borrowers carry the largest portions of risk.
Self-employed: $34.9M (27.1%)
Full-time: $33.48M (25.98%)
3. Poor Credit Scores Dominate Customer Base
Majority of customers fall under the "Poor" credit score bucket.
Customers with poor credit are mostly Full-time and Part-time employed, increasing portfolio risk.
Creditworthiness is not uniformly distributed across education levels and genders.
4. Loan Types Are Diversified but Risk Is Spread
Total loan amount is $253M, with each loan type (Student, Auto, Mortgage, Personal, Small Business) making up around 20% share.
However, all loan types show presence in defaulted, closed, and active statuses — indicating risk is not limited to a specific loan type.
5. Customer Base Is Diverse but Skewed Toward Males
Total customers: 3134
Gender distribution:
Male: 43.75%
Female: 41.45%
Other: 14.81%
Education distribution is fairly balanced, but Graduates and Postgraduates dominate with 53.44% combined.
Average age is 44 years, and average income is ₹99.27K, suggesting a relatively mature and mid-income customer base.
